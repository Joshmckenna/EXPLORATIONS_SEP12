# EXPLORATIONS_SEP12


Current state of the project - September 12, 10:57am

Prototype is currently unfinished, but in progress. Had broken pipes last night above my bathroom that had to be taken care of with property owner. Also did not allocate enough time in the week to finalize/choose electives and audit courses, respectively. 

In hindsight should not have taken four, 3-hour classes Monday + Tuesday. 

None-the-less, have index.html page as a brand introduction and product feature for the customer, have also a loginPage.html as the demo login where user decides which personal data to sync with application. Next page is loading.html, which is unfinished: first time referencing three.js library, will have to practice that for final delivery. Page will show other users around the world who have also opted to take control of their personal data (Brand confidence page). Next page is dataDashboard.html, this is a sort of buzzfeed type style of demonstrating the results of the data to show how advertisers are targeting you. 

Pages to be added: shop.html
